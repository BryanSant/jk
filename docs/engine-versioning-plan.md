# One daemon, many versions: engine lifecycle, storage unification, signed releases

Status: IMPLEMENTED P1-P6 (2026-07-13) — VersionStore + CAS-unified storage, frozen
protocol-zero + endpoint takeover, lock toolchain pin + --job downward delegation,
Ed25519-signed releases + `jk self update`, `jk wrapper` with the springboard, and
ledger-driven version GC. Outstanding: the release pipeline itself (signs SHA256SUMS,
bakes ReleaseVerifier.BUILT_IN_KEY — a v1.0 roadmap item), sigstore transparency, and
`jk engine status` surfacing generations. Ground rules for multi-version jk coexistence — storage
layout, upgrade choreography, delegation, signing, `jk self update`.

## 0. What exists today (the deviation is real)

Two systems handle "get a runnable jk onto this machine":

| | Bootstrap path (install.sh / self-fetch) | Lock-pinned toolchain path |
|---|---|---|
| Client binary | `~/.jk/bin/jk` — ONE mutable slot, overwritten | n/a |
| Engine jar | `~/.jk/lib/jk-engine-<v>.jar` — one mutable slot; `EngineJarFetcher` self-fetches the client's own baked version | CAS blobs |
| Version skew | client **kills** a mismatched engine and starts its own | resolver-mediated |
| AOT | trained locally into `state/engine/engine-<hash>.aot`, keyed by jar+JDK identity, `.noaot` sticky marker | payloads ride the CAS |
| Verification | `SHA256SUMS` fetched from the same origin (integrity, NOT authenticity) | CAS hash after first fetch |

The bootstrap path predates the CAS discipline; the toolchain path grew up with it. The
kill-on-skew behavior means a newer client stomps a busy older engine (and vice versa),
and nothing is signed.

## 1. Ground rules

**R1 — All immutable bytes live in the CAS. Period.** Engine jars, client binaries, worker
jars, release payloads — one store, one integrity model, one GC (the AccessLedger),
and the never-share-an-inode rule already enforced. `~/.jk/lib` dies.

**R2 — Versions materialize side-by-side; one mutable pointer.**

```
~/.jk/
├── bin/jk                    → symlink to versions/<current>/bin/jk (atomic flip)
├── versions/<v>/             # immutable once materialized, COPIED out of the CAS
│   ├── bin/jk                # native client for this host
│   ├── lib/jk-engine.jar
│   └── manifest.toml         # artifact shas, worker pins, protocol version
├── state/engine/
│   ├── current.sock|pid|log… # the ONE daemon's runtime files (per-instance, as today)
│   └── <v>/                  # version-scoped DERIVED state: the trained .aot, .noaot
├── cache/                    # shared: CAS, actions, repos, jdks — version-agnostic
└── config.toml               # shared; forward-compatible (unknown keys ignored, never
                              # rewritten by an older version — read-modify-write preserves
                              # unknown content verbatim)
```

**R3 — AOT caches are derived state, never shipped.** JEP 514 caches are host + JDK-identity
+ jar specific. They are trained locally (existing flow, which is already right), live in
`state/engine/<v>/`, and are never CAS release payloads. If the toolchain path ships `.aot`
payloads today, that stops — a pinned engine trains its own on first clean stop, exactly
like the bootstrap engine.

**R4 — Exactly one daemon, and it is the newest version materialized on the machine.**
Pinned older versions never daemonize (see R6). "Newest locally available wins" also
answers cold start: the spawner scans `versions/`, launches the max.

**R5 — Upgrades hand off immediately; nobody drains against live traffic.** (This is the
one place this plan disagrees with the sketch — see §2.)

**R6 — Delegation is downward only; upward is replacement.**
- A build pinned to an *older* jk: the daemon materializes that version and execs its
  engine as a **child process over stdio** — the exact worker pattern (JSONL,
  protocol-prefixed lines, one job per process, exits when done). No second daemon, no
  socket, no AOT warmup expectations.
- A client (or pin) *newer* than the daemon: the daemon must not supervise semantics it
  postdates. Instead the client/daemon materializes the newer version and asks the old
  daemon to **yield** (§2). The newer engine becomes the daemon; the old one drains its
  in-flight jobs as a lame duck and exits.

**R7 — The handshake is frozen forever.** The first line of every connection, and the
`yield` verb, form a tiny protocol-zero that every jk version past and future speaks:
`{"t":"hello","jk":"<version>","proto":<int>}` → the daemon answers with its own. Everything
else may change behind a protocol-version bump; this must not. This is the one piece to
get exactly right *now* — it's what makes every future upgrade path possible.

## 2. Upgrade choreography: takeover, not lull-waiting

The sketch's drain mode (keep accepting requests, swap when jobs hit zero) has a starvation
hole: a busy CI box never reaches an organic lull, so it never upgrades — and "accept new
work while hoping for quiet" makes the lull *less* likely. Invert it, nginx-style:

1. New engine starts, binds a fresh generation-numbered endpoint
   (`state/engine/gen-<n>.sock` — or a named pipe on Windows), warms up (AOT training can
   come later; first run may be un-AOT'd).
2. New engine atomically replaces the **endpoint file** — `state/engine/endpoint`, a
   one-line pointer (`uds:gen-42.sock` / `pipe:jk-engine-42`) every client reads before
   connecting. Atomic file replace exists on BOTH platforms (POSIX rename;
   `MoveFileEx(MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)` on NTFS), so one code path serves Linux, macOS,
   and Windows — no socket-file rename semantics needed anywhere. From this instant every
   NEW connection lands on the new engine.
3. New engine notifies the old one (`yield` on protocol-zero) — belt and suspenders: the
   old engine also detects that `endpoint` no longer names its generation.
4. Old engine stops accepting, finishes in-flight jobs (nothing is killed), writes its AOT
   if it was recording, exits. New engine adopts the .pid/.log naming.

Degraded fallback (kept in the design, expected unused): if endpoint indirection proves
unreliable on some host, the old engine can soft-drain instead — refuse new connections
with a protocol-zero `busy-upgrading` answer (clients retry against the endpoint file),
finish in-flight work, exit. Never a hard kill except `jk self update --now`.

No lull needed. No job killed. The fleet converges immediately. In-flight jobs finish
under the version that started them — correct, since their pipelines/action keys were
computed by it.

Cross-engine safety during the overlap window (minutes at most): the CAS and action cache
are already concurrent-safe (atomic temp+rename writes, content addressing); per-project
serialization stays on jk.lock as today. Two engines briefly coexisting is the same story
as two user accounts sharing a cache mount.

## 3. Triggers

- **`jk self update`**: resolve `latest/VERSION`, verify + materialize into `versions/<v>/`
  (client binary AND engine jar — the pair is atomic, per releases.md), flip the `bin/jk`
  symlink, start the takeover (§2). Jobs never die; `--force` kills the old daemon and its
  jobs for the impatient (and is the recovery hatch for a wedged engine).
- **A lock pin newer than the daemon**: materialize + takeover, exactly as self update
  (the "eager upgrade" rule) — then the (new) daemon runs the build itself.
- **A lock pin older than the daemon**: child-exec delegation (R6), no takeover.
- **Client newer than daemon** (post-`self update` shells, mixed fleets): client sends
  hello, daemon answers with an older version, client materializes its own version if
  needed and requests yield. This replaces today's kill-on-skew.

## 4. Supply chain: sign the release, pin the hash

`SHA256SUMS` from the same origin as the artifacts authenticates nothing — whoever can
tamper with the jar can tamper with the sums. Two layers, both cheap:

1. **A minisign/ed25519 release key, baked into the client.** The release pipeline signs
   `SHA256SUMS` (one signature per release); every verifier (install.sh via the published
   pubkey, `jk self update` and toolchain fetches via the baked-in key) checks
   signature-then-hash before anything is materialized or executed. Key rotation uses the
   forward-compat pattern the signing schema already established (`next-store-file`): each
   release may carry `NEXT_RELEASE_KEY`, clients trust current ∪ next. Enterprise/air-gap:
   `[release] trusted-keys` in config.toml overrides.
2. **Transparency later, via what jk already ships**: the publisher plugin has sigstore +
   SLSA provenance support — dogfood it. Keyless-sign the same `SHA256SUMS` in CI, publish
   the bundle alongside; clients that can reach the log verify the release workflow's OIDC
   identity. Layer 1 works offline and is the floor; layer 2 adds auditability without
   becoming a hard dependency.

Once a version is in a `jk.lock`, the lock records `version + sha256` — every subsequent
fetch on any machine is CAS-verified against the pinned hash, so the signature check only
gates *first acquisition* of a version, and a compromised release site can't swap bytes
under an existing pin.

## 5. GC

`versions/<v>/` and `state/engine/<v>/` join the AccessLedger like any CAS blob: touch on
every launch/delegation. Prune keeps (a) current, (b) anything touched inside the
retention window, (c) nothing else — a stale pin re-materializes from the CAS or the
release site on demand, because R1 made materialization cheap and reproducible.

## 6. Implementation plan

Ordering rule: **P1+P2 ship in one release** — the first version that writes the
`versions/` layout and speaks protocol-zero is the floor every later upgrade stands on.
P3–P6 are independent after that.

### P1 — storage unification (foundation; no behavior change) — M

| Work item | Where |
|---|---|
| `VersionStore`: materialize `versions/<v>/` (bin/jk, lib/jk-engine.jar, manifest.toml) by COPY from the CAS; idempotent; verify-before-activate; `current()` scans for max | new, `kernel/client-io` (beside `Cas`/`RepoArtifactStore`) |
| Engine jar + client binary ingest via `Cas.putFile` on download/install | `EngineJarFetcher` (fetch → CAS → materialize, drop the direct `~/.jk/lib` write), `install.sh` (same layout in shell) |
| `bin/jk` becomes a symlink into `versions/<current>/bin/` (Windows: a tiny shim exe or copy — decide with the endpoint work) | `install.sh`, `InstallCommand` self-install path |
| Spawn from the version dir, not `~/.jk/lib` | `EngineClient` spawn path + `EnginePaths` (add `versionsDir()`, `versionRoot(v)`) |
| AOT + `.noaot` move to `state/engine/<v>/`; toolchain path confirmed to TRAIN locally, never ship `.aot` payloads | `EnginePaths` (aot naming), `EngineClient` AOT train/verify block (~L1277-1350) |
| `manifest.toml` written at materialization: artifact shas, worker-jar pins, protocol int | `VersionStore` |

Acceptance: fresh install produces the new layout; `jk build` works with `~/.jk/lib`
absent; re-install of the same version is a no-op; existing machines migrate lazily
(first run materializes the running version, leaves `lib/` for the old binary, prune
removes it later). Tests: `VersionStoreTest` (materialize/idempotence/verify-fail),
install.sh smoke in CI.

### P2 — protocol-zero + endpoint takeover — M/L (the careful one)

| Work item | Where |
|---|---|
| Protocol-zero: `hello {jk, proto}` exchanged first on every connection; unknown-proto answer shape; `yield`, `busy-upgrading` verbs. FROZEN — document in its own short spec section of docs/engine.md | `EngineProtocol` (new tiny message family), `EngineServer.handleConnection` (answer before dispatch), `EngineClient.connect` (send + read before first request) |
| Endpoint indirection: daemon binds `state/engine/gen-<n>.sock` (pipe on Windows), writes `state/engine/endpoint` via atomic replace; clients resolve endpoint → connect | `EnginePaths` (endpoint/generation naming; keep the hash-scoped state dir), `EngineServer` startup, `EngineClient.connect` |
| Takeover: `spawnAndTakeOver(v)` — start new engine, wait healthy (hello), atomic endpoint replace, send `yield` to the old generation | `EngineClient` (replaces `killStale` version-skew path), `EngineServer` (lame-duck mode: stop accepting, finish jobs, write AOT, exit) |
| Old-engine displacement watchdog: on accept-idle, re-stat `endpoint`; if it names another generation, enter lame-duck (covers a crashed taker-over) | `EngineServer` |
| Newest-locally-materialized wins on cold spawn | `EngineClient` spawn (consult `VersionStore.current()`), keeps working for -SNAPSHOT dev flow (running version self-materializes) |

Acceptance: two-version handoff under load — start a long build, `spawnAndTakeOver` a
newer engine, build finishes on the old engine while new requests land on the new one;
old engine exits at idle. Tests: protocol-zero unit tests (hello/yield encode/decode,
unknown proto), an `EngineServer` integration test driving a real takeover on localhost,
Windows named-pipe equivalent gated to a Windows CI lane. Kill-on-skew code deleted.

### P3 — downward delegation (pinned older toolchains) — M

| Work item | Where |
|---|---|
| Lock toolchain line: `jk = "<version>" sha256 = "<hex>"` written at lock time (grep-able, the wrapper's contract) | `LockfileWriter`/`LockfileReader`, `LockFlow` |
| Pin comparison at request intake: pin == daemon → run; pin < daemon → delegate; pin > daemon → materialize + takeover (§3) | `EngineServer` request pre-flight |
| Child-engine exec over stdio: `jk-engine … --job` one-shot mode (no socket, no daemonize, JSONL on stdout — the `PluginClient`/`PluginMain` pattern verbatim); daemon streams child events to the client unchanged | `EngineMain` (job mode flag), new `EngineDelegate` in `kernel/engine` (drives the child via `PluginClient`) |
| Child resolves ITS OWN worker set from its `manifest.toml` (never the daemon's) | `EngineDelegate` env/args |

Acceptance: a project locked to an older materialized version builds through the newer
daemon with byte-identical outputs to running that version directly; `jk-compat` mismatch
fails at parse with the pin named. Tests: two-version delegation integration test
(requires a second materialized version — use the -SNAPSHOT self-materialization for CI).

### P4 — signing + `jk self update` — M

| Work item | Where |
|---|---|
| Release pipeline signs `SHA256SUMS` (minisign/ed25519); `NEXT_RELEASE_KEY` rotation slot | release workflow (v1.0 roadmap item), docs/releases.md layout addendum (`SHA256SUMS.minisig`) |
| Client verification: signature → sums → per-artifact sha, before ANY materialization; baked-in pubkey + `[release] trusted-keys` override | `EngineJarFetcher` → generalize into `ReleaseFetcher` beside `VersionStore`; `install.sh` verifies with the published pubkey |
| `jk self update [--force]`: resolve latest, fetch+verify+materialize pair, flip `bin/jk`, takeover (`--force` = kill instead of yield) | new `SelfCommand` in `:cli`, reusing P2's takeover |
| Pin-hash enforcement: toolchain fetches for a locked version verify against the LOCK's sha, not just the sums | `ReleaseFetcher` lock-pin path |
| sigstore transparency layer (publisher plugin already ships the machinery) — optional verification when reachable | release workflow + `ReleaseFetcher`, LAST |

Acceptance: tampered artifact/sums rejected before materialization (unit tests with a test
key); `jk self update` on a busy daemon completes with zero killed jobs.

### P5 — `jk wrapper` — S/M

| Work item | Where |
|---|---|
| `jk wrapper [<v|latest>] [--emit]`: bare = regenerate at current pin; a version argument = springboard (materialize target, exec ITS `jk wrapper --emit`) | new `WrapperCommand` in `:cli` |
| Script templates (`./jk`, `jk.bat`): read lock line → have-or-fetch `versions/<v>/bin/jk` (sha-verified against the lock) → exec; `latest` bootstrap when no lock | templates as classpath resources beside the command; contract test that templates only depend on the frozen release layout + lock line |
| Docs: wrapper how-to + the cmd.exe shadowing note | docs/variants.md-style user doc or README section |

Acceptance: wrapper-only checkout (no `~/.jk`) bootstraps, builds, and `jk wrapper
latest` upgrades itself through the springboard on Linux and Windows lanes.

### P6 — GC + status — S

| Work item | Where |
|---|---|
| `versions/<v>/` + `state/engine/<v>/` in the AccessLedger (touch on launch/delegation); prune keeps current + retention window | `VersionStore`, `AccessLedger`, cache-prune pipeline |
| `jk engine status`: daemon version/generation, lame ducks, materialized versions, endpoint | `EngineServer` status handler + `jk status` surface (503fb0d2's panel) |

## 7. The project wrapper (`jk wrapper`)

`jk wrapper` writes `./jk` + `jk.bat` (committed, gradle-wrapper style) so a checkout
builds with its pinned jk on a machine with no — or the wrong — jk installed. Rules:

- **The wrapper is dumb and frozen.** ~50 lines of sh/bat that (1) read the exact pin,
  (2) materialize that client if missing, (3) exec it. It never resolves version
  selectors, never self-updates its own logic (regenerate via `jk wrapper`), and depends
  only on the two surfaces this plan freezes: the release layout (releases.md) and the
  lock's toolchain line.
- **The pin comes from `jk.lock`** — a grep-able single line recording
  `jk = "<version>" sha256 = "<hex>"`. jk.toml holds the *selector*; the lock holds the
  resolution, which is the only thing a shell script should touch. No lock yet → the
  wrapper bootstraps `latest/VERSION` and the real client takes over resolution
  (and locks) from there.
- **Materialize into the SAME `versions/<v>/` tree** — the wrapper is just a third writer
  of the layout self-update and the daemon's toolchain fetches already use. Download the
  platform artifact, verify `sha256` against the LOCK'S pinned hash (this makes wrapper
  verification strong with nothing but `sha256sum`/`CertUtil` — no minisign needed in
  shell for pinned versions; the unpinned-latest bootstrap verifies SHA256SUMS and prints
  the fingerprint it trusted), unpack to `~/.jk/versions/<v>/bin/jk`, exec.
- **The wrapper never touches `~/.jk/bin/jk`** — that symlink is the user's machine-global
  install. Wrapper-materialized versions and the global install coexist in `versions/`
  and share the CAS, config, JDKs, and the daemon. The exec'd client then speaks
  protocol-zero like any client: older daemon → yield/takeover; older pin → the daemon
  delegates downward. The wrapper needs no engine awareness at all.
- **Updating the wrapper springboards through the pinned client.** cmd.exe resolves a
  bare `jk` to the project's `jk.bat` (current-dir shadowing), so `jk wrapper` in a
  project dir always runs the PINNED — possibly old — client. That is fine, because the
  `wrapper` subcommand is a springboard, not a generator: `jk wrapper <x.y.z|latest>`
  resolves the requested version, materializes it into `versions/<v>/`, and **execs that
  version's own `jk wrapper --emit`** — the new client writes its own scripts and the new
  pin. The old client never needs to know newer script content; it only needs the
  springboard, which ships with the wrapper feature from day one. Bare `jk wrapper`
  (no --version) regenerates at the current pin — the self-repair case. The shell script
  itself stays 100% dumb: no flag interception, nothing to special-case in .bat.

## 8. Open questions

1. Should the *client* also delegate (old client, newer daemon)? Protocol-zero says the
   daemon answers with its version; older clients keep working against a newer daemon only
   if the wire stays backward-compatible per protocol int — that's the compatibility
   contract to state explicitly when P2 lands.
2. Worker/plugin jars are already version-pinned per engine (manifest.toml in
   versions/<v>/); confirm the delegation child resolves ITS worker set, not the daemon's.
3. Wrapper script naming: `./jk` + `jk.bat` as specified. `jk.bat` shadows a PATH `jk`
   inside cmd.exe sessions in that directory (cmd searches the current dir first;
   PowerShell requires `.\` and does not shadow) — intended for builds, and harmless for
   wrapper updates because `jk wrapper <version>` springboards (see §7).
